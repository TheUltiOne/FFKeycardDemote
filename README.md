# FFKeycardDemote

Demotes your keycard if you TK, or kills you if you have none!
Has two "keycard routes" to prevent downgrading to a better keycard!

For example:
**Person A** kills **Person B** as **friendly fire**. **Person A**'s keycard was a Guard Keycard, but it won't demote to a Major Scientist as that could be an upgrade!
**Person B** takes his revenge and kills **Person A** by Friendly Fire, when he has Cadet Keycard. It won't demote to a Containment Specialist, but Scientist Keycard. 

**All routes are configurable!**
