# SCPAnnouncement**

Announces all the SCPs at the start of the game, and fully customizable!!

## Default CASSIE Message config:
**Attention all personnel detected %scpcount SCP Subjects %scps**

For example, in a game this would be a possibility:
**Attention all personnel detected 5 SCP Subjects SCP-106 SCP-096 SCP-939-83 SCP-079 SCP-049**

You can remove %scps or %scpcount so for example it could only announce the number of SCPs!
